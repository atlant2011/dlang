MrTryHard's DLANG Repo
================================
All scripts found in this repo are open-sources. 
It means you can modify and use it as you wish.

A mention of the contributors is however welcomed in 
every use you do of any scripts.

* StringManip: Useful methods used to manipulate strings.
* Lists/dllist: Templated DoublyLinkedList*


Note: dllist still misses sort() method. It will come soon. Some code
correction will also follow eventually. Additional methods too.
