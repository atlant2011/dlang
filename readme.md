MrTryHard's DLANG Repo
================================
All scripts found in this repo are open-sources. 
It means you can modify and use it as you wish.

A mention of the contributors is however welcomed in 
every use you do of any scripts. All the following modules works with DMD2.065+ 
(have not been tested with previous versions) and are fully functionnal. They can 
be used in heavy use and should not cause any problems.
